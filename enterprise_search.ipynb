Partly, this is historical and methodological;\\nthe raw signal processing methods and expertise are generally\\ncovered in other courses (224s!) and other research communities,\\nthough there has been some convergence of techniques of late.\\nIn all aspects of NLP, most existing tools work for precious few (usu\\nally one, maybe up to 100) of the world’s roughly 7000 languages,\\nand fail disproportionately much on lesser-spoken and/or marginal\\nized dialects, accents, and more. Beyond this, recent successes in\\nbuilding better systems have far outstripped our ability to charac\\nterize and audit these systems. Biases encoded in text, from race to\\ngender to religion and more, are reflected and often amplified by\\nNLP systems. With these challenges and considerations in mind, but\\nwith the desire to do good science and build trustworthy systems\\nthat improve peoples’ lives, let’s take a look at a fascinating first\\nproblem in NLP.\\n\\n2 Representing words\\n2.1 Signifier and signified\\nConsider the sentence\\n\\nZuko makes the tea for his uncle.\\n\\nThe word Zuko is a sign, a symbol that represents an entity Zuko in\\nsome (real of imagined) world. The word tea is also a symbol that\\nrefers to a signified thing—perhaps a specific instance of tea. If one\\nwere instead to say Zuko likes to make tea for his uncle, note that the\\nsymbol Zuko still refers to Zuko, but now tea refers to a broader\\nclass—tea in general, not a specific bit of hot delicious water. Consider\\nthe two following sentences:\\n\\nZuko makes the coffee for his uncle.\\nZuko makes the drink for his uncle.\\n\\nWhich is “more like” the sentence about tea? The drink may be tea\\n(or it may be quite different!) and coffee definitely isn’t tea, but is yet\\nsimilar, no? And is Zuko similar to uncle because they both describe\\npeople? And is the similar to his because they both pick out specific\\ninstances of a class?\\nWord meaning is endlessly complex, deriving from humans’ goals\\nof communicating with each other and achieving goals in the world.\\nPeople use continuous media—speech, signing—but produce signs\\nin a discrete, symbolic structure—language—to express complex\\nmeanings.

Finally, each word occurrence is re-labeled to its associated cluster\\nand is used to train the word representation for that cluster.\\nFor a more rigorous treatment on this topic, one should refer to\\nthe original paper.\\n\\n3 Training for Extrinsic Tasks\\nWe have so far focused on intrinsic tasks and emphasized their\\nimportance in developing a good word embedding technique. Of\\ncourse, the end goal of most real-world problems is to use the result\\ning word vectors for some other extrinsic task. Here we discuss the\\ngeneral approach for handling extrinsic tasks.\\n3.1 Problem Formulation\\n\\nMost NLP extrinsic tasks can be formulated as classification tasks.\\nFor instance, given a sentence, we can classify the sentence to have\\npositive, negative or neutral sentiment. Similarly, in named-entity\\nrecognition (NER), given a context and a central word, we want\\nto classify the central word to be one of many classes. For the in\\nput, \"Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006\", we would\\nlike a classified output \"[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme\\nCorp.]Organization in [2006]Time.\"\\n\\nFigure 5: We can classify word vectors\\nusing simple linear decision boundaries\\nsuch as the one shown here (2-D word\\nvectors) using techniques such as\\nlogistic regression and SVMs\\n\\nFor such problems, we typically begin with a training set of the\\nform:\\n\\n{x (i)\\n\\n, y\\n\\n(i) }\\n\\nN\\n1\\n\\nwhere x\\n\\n(i) is a d-dimensional word vector generated by some word\\nembedding technique and y\\n(i) is a C-dimensional one-hot vector\\nwhich indicates the labels we wish to eventually predict (sentiments,\\nother words, named entities, buy/sell decisions, etc.).\\nIn typical machine learning tasks, we usually hold input data and\\ntarget labels fixed and train weights using optimization techniques\\n(such as gradient descent, L-BFGS, Newton’s method, etc.). In NLP\\napplications however, we introduce the idea of retraining the input\\nword vectors when we train for extrinsic tasks. Let us discuss when\\nand why we should consider doing this.\\n\\nImplementation Tip: Word vector\\nretraining should be considered for\\nlarge training datasets. For small\\ndatasets, retraining word vectors will\\nlikely worsen performance.' metadata={'source': 'gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/stanford-cs-224/cs224n-2019-notes02-wordvecs2.pdf', 'id': '1ff1e859cfb0a87e309c43035be20ec9'}\n",
