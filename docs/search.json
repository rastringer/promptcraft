    "text": "Welcome\nPromptCraft is a course to take developers from language model prompting to a prototype application in three days.\nLLMs and Generative AI have revolutionised the field of machine learning. The power of the foundational models, prompt tuning and model adaption mean practitioners can achieve what used to take weeks or months in a matter of days.\nThis course uses Google Cloud’s Generative AI Studio and is spread over three sessions, or days.\n\nDay one covers how to use clever prompting to categorize data, give effective responses grounded in data, validate, keep safe and evaluate outputs.\nDay two includes an introduction to Langchain, a popular library for interacting and building applications with LLMs, embedding data such as PDF reports or a product catalog, then retrieving accurate responses, summaries and answers.\nDay three is a hackathon, where participants choose a use case, bring or create (via an LLM!) some data, and create a proof-of-concept application.\n\nAll lessons are launched via Colab. The course only requires the free tier to complete.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA Google Cloud account.\nA Google Cloud project with billing enabled.\nFamiliarity with programming in Python."

Using the Wayfair WANDS dataset of more than 42,000 products, we will go through the following steps:\n\nDownload the data into a pandas dataframe\nGenerate embeddings for the product descriptions\nCreate and deploy and index of the embeddings on Vertex AI Matching Engine, a service which enables nearest neighbor search at scale\nPrompt an LLM to retrieve relevant product suggestions from the embedded data.\n\n \nImages from wayfair.co.uk\n\n\n10.0.2 Technologies\nIn this notebook, we will use:\n\nVertex AI’s language model\nVertex AI Matching Engine, a high-scale, low-latency vector database.\n\n\n# Install the packages\n! pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform\n! pip3 install shapely&lt;2.0.0\n\n\n\n10.0.3 Colab only: Uncomment the following cell to restart the kernel\n\n# Automatically restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages\nimport IPython\n\napp = IPython.Application.instance()\napp.kernel.do_shutdown(True)\n\nSet your Google Cloud project id and region\n\nPROJECT_ID = \"&lt;...&gt;\"  # @param {type:\"string\"}\n\n# Set the project id\n! gcloud config set project {PROJECT_ID}\n\n\nREGION = \"&lt;...&gt;\"  # @param {type: \"string\"}\n\nWe will need a Cloud Storage bucket to store embeddings initially. Please create a bucket and add the URI below.\n\nBUCKET_URI = \"gs://&lt;...&gt;\"\n\nAuthenticate your Google Cloud account Depending on your Jupyter environment, you may have to manually authenticate. Follow the relevant instructions below.\n\nVertex AI Workbench\n\nDo nothing as you are already authenticated.\n\nLocal JupyterLab instance, uncomment and run:\n\n\n# ! gcloud auth login\n\n\nColab, uncomment and run:\n\n\nfrom google.colab import auth\nauth.authenticate_user()\n\nInstall and intialize the SDK and language model.
