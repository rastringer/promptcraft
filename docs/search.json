    "text": "Welcome\nPromptCraft is a course to take developers from language model prompting to a prototype application in three days.\nLLMs and Generative AI have revolutionised the field of machine learning. The power of the foundational models, prompt tuning and model adaption mean practitioners can achieve what used to take weeks or months in a matter of days.\nThis course uses Google Cloud’s Generative AI Studio and is spread over three sessions, or days.\n\nDay one covers how to use clever prompting to categorize data, give effective responses grounded in data, validate, keep safe and evaluate outputs.\nDay two includes an introduction to Langchain, a popular library for interacting and building applications with LLMs, embedding data such as PDF reports or a product catalog, then retrieving accurate responses, summaries and answers.\nDay three is a hackathon, where participants choose a use case, bring or create (via an LLM!) some data, and create a proof-of-concept application.\n\nAll lessons are launched via Colab. The course only requires the free tier to complete.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA Google Cloud account.\nA Google Cloud project with billing enabled.\nFamiliarity with programming in Python."

The word tea is also a symbol that\\nrefers to a signified thing—perhaps a specific instance of tea. If one\\nwere instead to say Zuko likes to make tea for his uncle, note that the\\nsymbol Zuko still refers to Zuko, but now tea refers to a broader\\nclass—tea in general, not a specific bit of hot delicious water. Consider\\nthe two following sentences:\\n\\nZuko makes the coffee for his uncle.\\nZuko makes the drink for his uncle.\\n\\nWhich is “more like” the sentence about tea? The drink may be tea\\n(or it may be quite different!) and coffee definitely isn’t tea, but is yet\\nsimilar, no? And is Zuko similar to uncle because they both describe\\npeople? And is the similar to his because they both pick out specific\\ninstances of a class?\\nWord meaning is endlessly complex, deriving from humans’ goals\\nof communicating with each other and achieving goals in the world.\\nPeople use continuous media—speech, signing—but produce signs\\nin a discrete, symbolic structure—language—to express complex\\nmeanings.

Of\\ncourse, the end goal of most real-world problems is to use the result\\ning word vectors for some other extrinsic task. Here we discuss the\\ngeneral approach for handling extrinsic tasks.\\n3.1 Problem Formulation\\n\\nMost NLP extrinsic tasks can be formulated as classification tasks.\\nFor instance, given a sentence, we can classify the sentence to have\\npositive, negative or neutral sentiment. Similarly, in named-entity\\nrecognition (NER), given a context and a central word, we want\\nto classify the central word to be one of many classes. For the in\\nput, \"Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006\", we would\\nlike a classified output \"[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme\\nCorp.]Organization in [2006]Time.\"\\n\\nFigure 5: We can classify word vectors\\nusing simple linear decision boundaries\\nsuch as the one shown here (2-D word\\nvectors) using techniques such as\\nlogistic regression and SVMs\\n\\nFor such problems, we typically begin with a training set of the\\nform:\\n\\n{x (i)\\n\\n, y\\n\\n(i) }\\n\\nN\\n1\\n\\nwhere x\\n\\n(i) is a d-dimensional word vector generated by some word\\nembedding technique and y\\n(i) is a C-dimensional one-hot vector\\nwhich indicates the labels we wish to eventually predict (sentiments,\\nother words, named entities, buy/sell decisions, etc.).\\nIn typical machine learning tasks, we usually hold input data and\\ntarget labels fixed and train weights using optimization techniques\\n(such as gradient descent, L-BFGS, Newton’s method, etc.). In NLP\\napplications however, we introduce the idea of retraining the input\\nword vectors when we train for extrinsic tasks. Let us discuss when\\nand why we should consider doing this.\\n\\nImplementation Tip: Word vector\\nretraining should be considered for\\nlarge training datasets. For small\\ndatasets, retraining word vectors will\\nlikely worsen performance.' metadata={'source': 'gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/stanford-cs-224/cs224n-2019-notes02-wordvecs2.pdf', 'id': '1ff1e859cfb0a87e309c43035be20ec9'}\npage_content='2. The Benchmark Tasks\\nIn this section, we briefly introduce four standard NLP tasks on which we will benchmark our\\narchitectures within this paper: Part-Of-Speech tagging (POS), chunking (CHUNK), Named Entity\\nRecognition (NER) and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). For each of them, we consider a standard\\nexperimental setup and give an overview of state-of-the-art systems on this setup. The experimental\\nsetups are summarized in Table 1, while state-of-the-art systems are reported in Table 2.\\n2.1 Part-Of-Speech Tagging\\nPOS aims at labeling each word with a unique tag that indicates its syntactic role, for example, plural\\nnoun, adverb, . . .\\nA standard benchmark setup is described in detail by Toutanova et al.

We accomplish this by using a trained model (from Vertex) that knows “Lightsaber” and “Jedi” should be close together in the ‘embedding space’.

Using the Wayfair WANDS dataset of more than 42,000 products, we will go through the following steps:\n\nDownload the data into a pandas dataframe\nGenerate embeddings for the product descriptions\nCreate and deploy and index of the embeddings on Vertex AI Matching Engine, a service which enables nearest neighbor search at scale\nPrompt an LLM to retrieve relevant product suggestions from the embedded data.\n\n \nImages from wayfair.co.uk\n\n\n11.0.2 Technologies\nIn this notebook, we will use:\n\nVertex AI’s language model\nVertex AI Matching Engine, a high-scale, low-latency vector database.\n\n\n# Install the packages\n! pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform\n! pip3 install shapely&lt;2.0.0\n\n\n\n11.0.3 Colab only: Uncomment the following cell to restart the kernel\n\n# Automatically restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages\nimport IPython\n\napp = IPython.Application.instance()\napp.kernel.do_shutdown(True)\n\nSet your Google Cloud project id and region\n\nPROJECT_ID = \"&lt;...&gt;\"  # @param {type:\"string\"}\n\n# Set the project id\n! gcloud config set project {PROJECT_ID}\n\n\nREGION = \"&lt;...&gt;\"  # @param {type: \"string\"}\n\nWe will need a Cloud Storage bucket to store embeddings initially. Please create a bucket and add the URI below.\n\nBUCKET_URI = \"gs://&lt;...&gt;\"\n\nAuthenticate your Google Cloud account Depending on your Jupyter environment, you may have to manually authenticate. Follow the relevant instructions below.\n\nVertex AI Workbench\n\nDo nothing as you are already authenticated.\n\nLocal JupyterLab instance, uncomment and run:\n\n\n# ! gcloud auth login\n\n\nColab, uncomment and run:\n\n\nfrom google.colab import auth\nauth.authenticate_user()\n\nInstall and intialize the SDK and language model.
